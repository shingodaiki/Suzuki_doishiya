# Installing GitHub for Unity

## Requirements

- [Unity 5.4 or higher](https://store.unity.com/download). Personal edition is fine.

## Installation

- Create a new Unity project.
- Download the latest release from the [releases page](https://github.com/github/UnityInternal/releases) and double-click the unitypackage file. The package will install itself into the project currently opened in Unity, and Unity will automatically load it once all the files are in the project.
