You will need to create a GitHub account before you can sign in, if you don't have one already.

- For more information on creating a GitHub account, see "[Signing up for a new GitHub account](https://help.github.com/articles/signing-up-for-a-new-github-account/)".

### Personal access tokens

If the sign in operation above fails, you can manually create a personal access token and use it as your password.

The scopes for the personal access token are: `user`, `repo`.
- *user* scope: Grants access to the user profile data. We currently use this to display your avatar and check whether your plans lets you publish private repositories.
- *repo* scope: Grants read/write access to code, commit statuses, invitations, collaborators, adding team memberships, and deployment statuses for public and private repositories and organizations. This is needed for all git network operations (push, pull, fetch), and for getting information about the repository you're currently working on.

<sub>***Note:*** *Some older versions of the plugin ask for `gist` and `write:public_key`.*</sub>

For more information on creating personal access tokens, see "[Creating a personal access token for the command line](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-personal-access-token-for-the-command-line).
