# Getting Started with GitHub for Unity
There are often three states that you might be in when you are setting up your GitHub for Unity package with your Unity project:  
[Setting up a brand new repository](#setting-up-a-new-repository): You do not currently have your Unity project in a repository and you want to publish it to one.
[Connecting to an existing respository](#connecting-to-an-existing-repository): Your Unity project is already in a repository, but you do not have the GitHub for Unity package installed within it yet.
[Opening a Unity project that already has the GitHub for Unity package](#connecting-to-an-existing-repository-that-already-has-the-github-for-unity-package): Your Unity project is already in a repository and it already has the GitHub for Unity package and you are trying to setup a new machine.
