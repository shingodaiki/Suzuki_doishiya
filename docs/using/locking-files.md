An additional way to lock a file is by selecting it and going to `Assets` -> `Request Lock`.

## View locks

After requesting a lock, a lock icon appears in the bottom right-hand corner of the file.

3. Select the file to unlock and go to select the menu option `Assets` -> `Release Lock`.

Note: There are also two options for how to release a lock on a file. Always choose the `Release Lock` option first. The `Release Lock (forced)` option can be used to remove someone else's lock.
